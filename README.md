# OC - An experimental C-derived language and compiler
A compiler built on yacc/bison to compile the "oc" language, a language utilized by Professor Wesley Mackey in the Fundamentals of Compiler Design I course at UCSC. This is my attempt at self-teaching the course with a curriculum that includes compilers and compiler design from the Dragon book. Additional work was supplemented by Wesley Mackey's CMPS104a course notes.

## Note to students
***I cannot guarantee any of this work is correct except for the rudimentary testing I have done.*** You have a responsibility to act honestly and promote Academic Integrity. Utilizing this work for your own assignments does not reflect this integrity and is absolutely forbidden without attribution. If I was able to self-teach myself the majority of the course's material and assignments, you definitely will be able to at least complete the assignments under the guidance of an instructor. The "possibly passing" grade this work would get is not worth the Academic Dishonesty mark on your record, nor is it worth sacrificing your learning for.
