# OC - An experimental C-derived language and compiler
A compiler built on yacc/bison to compile the "oc" language, a language that Professor Wesley Mackey came up with for the Fundamentals of Compiler Design I course at UCSC. This is my attempt at self-teaching compilers and compiler design from the Dragon book as well as Wesley Mackey's CMPS104a course notes.
